<h2>Main Learning Points</h2>
<ul>
<li> This hackathon had a lot of requirements to meet in less than 5 hours, with a team of only 3 people.
<li> Communication is key and creating simple wireframes after visiting other restaurant websites for inspiration ensured that we were all on the same page. View our wireframes <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPYvbnb8=/?share_link_id=37337720412">here</a>.
<li> I used local storage for the first time, I have been aware of it for a while but it was really interesting to actually make use of it. This allowed data to persist between sessions and meant that the user could navigate between pages, refresh, close the page and reopen it and still keep their chosen menu items in their basket.
<li> We made use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML to allow us to use the text formatting that the API provides. I am aware that this isn't best practice but given the time contraints that we had, we didn't have the luxury of spending a long time looking for alternatives. The feedback we got from our presentation about this was reassuring though. The industry professional who heard our presentation said that he would also have used dangerouslySetInnerHTML in our situation but recommended that we look into parsing alternatives for next time.
